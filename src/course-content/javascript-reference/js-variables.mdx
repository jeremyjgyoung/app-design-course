# JavaScript Variables & Data

Variables hold values. 
Variables allow you to type a variable name instead of a long value, keep your code organized, and make it easy to change a value.

```js
// earthAge is a variable name
let earthAge = 4543000000;

alert("The earth is " + earthAge + " years old.");
```

## Variable Syntax

In JavaScript, you will see a keyword, a variable name, the equal sign, and the value to setup a variable.

```js
let lastName = "Young";
```

There are two steps to setting up a variable. First, is to declare the variable which sets the name of the variable.
The second step is to initialize the variable which sets the starting value of a variable. 
You can do both steps in one or two lines of code.

```js
// Declare a variable
let stepCount;

// Initialize a variable
stepCount = 0;

// Declare and initialize a variable in a single step
let stepCount = 0;
```

## Variable Keywords

There are three keywords used to declare a variables: let, var, and const.

For this course we will be using let as the default.
The other two keywords have a similar use but const cannot be reassigned and var can be used in more places.

With JavaScript you do not denote the data type when declaring the variable unlike many other programming languages.

## Data Types

You may have noticed quotes around certain values. 
Strings are text and include quotes.
The other two most common data types in JavaScript are numbers and booleans. 
Booleans has two values true and false.

```js
// Examples of Strings
let firstName = "Sarah";
let favDinosaur = "Archaeopteryx";
let aQuote = "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

// Examples of Numbers
let partOfPi = 3.14;
let startValue = 0;
let aLargeNumber = 999999999999999;

// Examples of Booleans
let signedIn = true;
let darkModeOn = false;
```
## Names & Capitalization

When you name a variable you should use a short yet descriptive word or phrase. 
A convention for naming variables is capitalizing every word except the first.

A common bug in code is a slight mispelling - the computer needs references to variables to be the exact same as the variable name.

## Data Structures

To hold related values, we will use two types of data structures.

An array holds a list of related values.

```js
let listOfGroceries = [Coconut Milk", "Potatoes", "Carrots", "Chillies", "Ginger", "Garlic", "Onions"];
```

An object holds a pairs of related values.

```js
let userDetails = { firstName: "Mary", lastName: "Chen", userName: "mchen79", signedIn: false, age: 41};
```
