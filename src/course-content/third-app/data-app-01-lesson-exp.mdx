# Explanation of Activity Set 3.1

This will explain the concepts from the last activity set.

## Data

Data is important in an app.
Often data will change based on the user.
In our examples, data has includes emojis and to dos.
Our data has been held as data types of strings and the data structure of an array.
State is data contained in our app.

## useState

In the useState hook we define the name of our state, what we use to change the state, and the initial state.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

In the example above, count is the name of the current state, setCount is the name of the function we call to change state, and 0 is the initial state.

## Using State

In order to use the state, we can treat state like any other variable.

```jsx
<Text>{count}</Text>
```

The curly braces allow us to use JavaScript in our JSX.
Numbers and text we show in a Text component.

Since useState is a special word that uses code from the React library.
We need to import useState from React.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

## Changing State

Often you want to change the state when something happens, for instance a button is pressed.

In the first activity set we had a button that uses the updateEmoji function when pressed.
Then in the function we use setEmojiData() to change the state to a pizza emoji.

```jsx
let App = () => {
    let [emojiData, setEmojiData] = useState("");

    let updateEmoji = () => {
        setEmojiData("üçï");
    };

    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
        <TouchableOpacity 
            onPress={updateEmoji}
            style={styles.button}
        >
            <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Press This</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <Text style={styles.emoji}>{emojiData}</Text>
        </View>
    );
    };
```
