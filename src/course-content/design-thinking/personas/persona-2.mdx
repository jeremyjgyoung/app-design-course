## Parent Working from Home

Mark is a father of two children - Katrina, age 5 and Caleb, age 2. His wife works part time and neither child is currently attending daycare due to the coronavirus. They all recently moved to a new home.

Mark works from home. He has a lot of responsibility but is much more motivated by his family than his job. He is struggling to focus on work for a variety of reasons. He is often responsible for watching children during his work day, and when he is not responsible for watching them he can still hear them learning and playing in the house.

Mark is also distracted because he works to support his family. He adores his family and would much rather spend time with them than work. He hears frequent reminders of everything he is missing while he works in front of his computer and attends meetings on Zoom.
