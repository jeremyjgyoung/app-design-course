# Persona #6

## Delivery Driver

Chris is a professional driver in San Francisco. He used to primarily drive people but ever since the pandemic hit he has turned towards delivering food. This is his full-time job but he relies on there being people who need rides or food delivered. His financial situation is tight.

In the November election there is a proposition on the ballot that may significantly impact his position. He is worried about the changes that may come after this election. He would love to have a way to get more details beyond the paid-for advertising on what impacts he can expect on his life if this proposition passes or fails.

Chris also owns property and sees that multiple other propositions affect his tax rates. He has looked at the ballot mailer, watched ads and read up on them online and finds the entire system incredibly confusing.
