# Assignments

For each assignment, there is a similar process for submission. Let's practice by completing and submitting an assignment.

## Master Link Document Directions

First we will make our own copy of the Master Link Document. We will only need to do this once for this course.

**Step One**

Make a copy of the Master Link Document. Each student will have their own copy.

**Step Two**

Rename it with your team and your name.

Fill out your name, team number, and team member(s).

Your team number is the same as your Zoom room.

**Step Three**

Submit the link on Canvas.

<a href="https://dtechhs.instructure.com/courses/1129" target="_blank"  class="mdxLink">App Design Canvas</a>

This document will be updated throughout the course.

**Step Four**

Write an email to yourself with the URL.

The Master Link document is the most important document for this course. You will use this same document for every submission.
