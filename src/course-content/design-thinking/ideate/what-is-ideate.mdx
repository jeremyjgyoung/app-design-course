# What is Ideate?

During the Ideate phase designers generate ideas. Ideas are answers to the How Might We question(s) developed in the Define phase.

The mindsets held during ideation should encourage creative ideas. Creative ideas are born when criticism is reserved and bold ideas are fostered.

## Ideation Guidelines

Here are a few guidelines that can help encourage creative ideas:

- **Defer Judgment** - Creative spaces are judgment-free zones—they let ideas flow so people can build from each other's great ideas.

- **Encourage Wild Ideas** - Embrace the most out-of-the-box notions. There’s often not a whole lot of difference between outrageous and brilliant.

- **Build on the Ideas of Others** -Try to use “and” instead of “but," it encourages positivity and inclusivity and leads to tons of ideas.

- **Stay Focused on the Topic** - Try to keep the discussion on target. Divergence is good, but you still need to keep your eyes on the prize.

- **One Conversation at a Time** - This can be difficult—especially with lots of creative people in a single room—but always think about the challenge topic and how to stay on track.

- **Go for Quantity** - Crank your ideas out quickly. For any 60-minute session, you should try to generate 100 ideas.
