# Persona #3

## Teacher

Helana is a 29 year old sixth-grade English teacher in Raleigh, North Carolina. She has been married for three years and lives with her husband and his elderly mother. Although she was originally uncomfortable with the idea of living with her mother-in-law they have become very close.

Helana loves being a teacher because of all of the personal interactions she got to have with her students before the pandemic. Her school is moving from distance learning to in-person classes for the spring semester. She is extremely ambivalent about the change. Working with students through distance learning has been a challenge and she knows that some of her students have been falling behind due to being unable to work from their homes. 

Helana is also exceedingly worried about getting infected with the coronavirus and bringing the disease home and infecting her family. She has been following the infection rate in the state of North Carolina, and it is currently listed as having an Uncontrolled Spread - the worst category on the chart. Helana lacks confidence in her school’s ability to keep the pandemic out of the school.
