## Showing a Map

Each View component you can think of as a rectangle.
Often we have one rectangle wrapping other rectangles.
The View rectangle wrapping the other components is called the parent
and the rectangles being wrapped are the children.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.parent}>
      <View style={styles.childOne}></View>
      <View style={styles.childTwo}></View>
      <View style={styles.childThree}></View>
    </View>
  );
}
```

The parent decides on the direction of the children. The children have control over their flex number which affects how much space they take up.
