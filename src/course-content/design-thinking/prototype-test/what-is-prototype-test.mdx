# What is Prototyping and Testing?

Prototyping and testing go hand in hand. In the Prototype phase, designers create a quick solution to their users' needs. In the Testing phase, designers gain feedback from users to see if their prototype is on the right track. The goal of these phases are to build a understanding of what the correct solution is for their users.

During prototyping, the goal is to build an app design you will learn from. Typically, as you gain knowledge the quality and specificity of your prototype increases. For instance, it is not important to get the style of your app looking nice if you don't know what type of app you are building.

In the testing phase, you are trying to learn if you are building the correct app to solve for your user's needs. The testing phase works best when you frame the feedback you want. Constructive feedback on your app is golden. Remember to be kind, specific, and helpful when providing feedback.
