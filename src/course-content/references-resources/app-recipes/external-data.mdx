## Code Explanation

This is a more complete project than we have seen from our other code examples. Look under the Component folder to see relevant data.

If we look at **USCurrentData.js** we can see that it asks for the JSON from the covid tracking API linked below.

<a href='https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/us/current.json' target='_blank' class="mdxLink">
    JSON for Current US COVID Stats
</a>

The code asks for this data and transforms the data into a format that is readable.
