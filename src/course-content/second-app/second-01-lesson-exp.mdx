# Explanation of Activity Set 2.1

This will explain the concepts from the last activity set.

# Components' Syntax & Concepts

Components are written with the component name surrounded by "<" and ">".

```jsx
// This is a Text component
<Text>My text component</Text>
```

Inside the component you will often have more information like text or another component.

```jsx
// Text inside of the two tags
<Text>Here is text.</Text>

// Other components
<View>
    <View></View>
    <View></View>
</View>
```

Some components like the Image component don't need anything inside of it so it does not have a closing tag.

```jsx
// Self-Closing Tag
<Image />

// More information inside the component
<Text>Here is text.</Text>
```

Within the first tag there will often be something to tell the component more information.
For instance, where the image is located or how to style the component.
These are called props or attributes.

```jsx
// The Text component with a style prop
<Text style={styles.title}>Press Me</Text>

// The Image component with a style prop and a source prop
<Image
    style={styles.image}
    source={require("./forest-image.jpg")} 
/>
// Note that the white space makes it easier to read but has the same function
```

# The Image Component

The Image component tells the computer which file to load, in addition
to the style of the image which must include the width and height.

```jsx
<Image 
    style={styles.dogImage}
    source={require('./fluffy-dog.jpg')} 
/>
```

The Image tag does not have a closing tag because we don't put things inside of an Image tag. 
Note when you have multiple props for a component you will often put it on different lines to make the component more readable.

# The TouchableOpacity Component

TouchableOpacity is used as a button.
It has a special attribute called onPress which runs code when the button is pressed.

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity
    style={styles.pressMeButton}
    onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
>
</TouchableOpacity>
```
Refer to the box model when adding styles to TouchableOpacity.

If you text in your button you'll need to embed a Text component within the TouchableOpacity component.

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity
    style={styles.pressMeButton}
    onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
>
    <Text>Press Me</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

# Event Handlers & Functions

TouchableOpacity is used as a button.

## Events

An event is an action that happens in your app.
An action could include a button press or hovering over a button.

The TouchableOpacity component will "listen" for events if you add an attribute like onPress or onLongPress.

```jsx
// TouchableOpacity with the onPress attribute that names the function used when activated
<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.pressMeButton}
  onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
>
  <Text>Press Me</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## Event Handler

The event handler is the function that runs once an event happens.
For instance, functionActivatedWhenPressed is run after the user presses the TouchableOpacity component.

```jsx
let App = () => {
  // functionActivatedWhenPressed is an event handeler
  let functionActivatedWhenPressed = () => {
    alert("Pressed!");
    console.log("Yeah, definitely pressed the button");
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TouchableOpacity
        style={styles.pressMeButton}
        onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
      >
        <Text>Press Me</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
};
```

# Arrow Functions

A function is a piece of code that performs a task.
Functions allow you to reuse code and make code easier to read.

```js
let functionActivatedWhenPressed = () => {
  alert("Pressed!");
  console.log("Yeah, definitely pressed the button");
};
```

For this function, we have a name of functionActivatedWhenPressed, no parameters, and the thing it does in curly braces which is to alert and print messages.

Let's look at another function.

```js
let addFunction = (a, b, c) => {
  return a + b + c;
};
```

This function has a name of addFunction, parameters a, b, and c, and it performs the task of adding a,b, and c.

```js
let addFunction = (a, b, c) => {
  return a + b + c;
};

let res = addFunction(3, 5, 1);
alert(res);
```

In this chunk of code we use addFunction passing it parameters of 3, 5, and 1. 
The result that will be 9.
Then 9 will be alerted to the screen.
