## Add the URL to the Master Link Document

Share the URL with your team and put the URL into your Master Link Document.

## Your Presentation

**Time: 20 minutes**

Work on your presentation. You can decide to split up your team to work on the presentation and the app. Be sure that all of your team sees the presentation and knows what parts they are going to talk about for the presentation.

Your presentation should include:

- **An Introduction -** Who are you, what did you work on, the design challenge, and other important context.
- **Your User and Your Users' Needs -** What was the challenge you worked on?
- **Your Work -** Show your process in getting to a solution.
- **Your App -** Show your app demo. It is smart to include a video/screen recording.
- **An Outro -** Say thank you and give time for feedback and questions.

## Mark Done on Your Master Link Document

Once you have completed your presentation, mark an **x** in the done column for the Presentation.
