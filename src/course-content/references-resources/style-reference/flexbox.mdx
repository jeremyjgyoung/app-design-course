Flexbox allows us to place elements.

## The View Component

Each View component you can think of as a rectangle.
Often we have one rectangle wrapping other rectangles.
The View rectangle wrapping the other components is called the parent
and the rectangles being wrapped are the children.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.parent}>
      <View style={styles.childOne}></View>
      <View style={styles.childTwo}></View>
      <View style={styles.childThree}></View>
    </View>
  );
}
```

The parent decides on the direction of the children. The children have control over their flex number which affects how much space they take up.

## Flex Direction

Since Expo is used to build mobile apps the default direction set to column (since your phone is typically vertical).
You can change the flexDirection to row. The parent View component sets the flex direction for all its child View components.

## Flex Number

The flex number is a ratio for how much space an element takes up.
For instance, if there are two boxes in a flex container with a flex number of
2 and 3 - then the first box will take up two-fifths of the space and the other box will take up three-fifths of the space.

## Example with a Flex Direction & Number

Change the flex direction and number to see how it affects the boxes.

## The Two Axes

There are two axes: the main axis and the cross axis.

If the flex direction is in the row orientation, then the main axis runs from left to right and the cross axis runs from top to bottom.
If the flex direction is in the column orientation, then the main axis runs from top to bottom and the cross axis runs from left to right.

## justifyContent and alignItems

The children of the main container can be at the start (flex-start), end (flex-end), or center.
On the main axis justifyContent is the property to use and on the cross axis alignItems is the property to use.

Change the axis, justifyContent, and alignItems, respectively, with the dropdowns below.
