## How to Write a Point of View Statement

In the Define Worksheet write a Point of View statement.

In the video below Sarah describes the User Needs Statement or a POV Statement.

The standard format of a POV statement is: 

**[user description]** needs a way to **[need]** in order to/so that/because **[goal/insight]**.

The POV statement should provide context for what we are solving for and **not** hint at the exact solution.

In the class Design for Extreme Affordability, a group was tasked with designing the incubator for 1% of the cost. Instead starting the engineering process, the team started with understanding their user. Here is a POV statement that would work for them:

**Sugata, a desperate parent living in a remote village,** needs **the means to give her premature baby a way to survive** because **modern healthcare options are unaffordable and more than 4-hours away**.

Let's breakdown each part and see why this is a good example for a POV statement. The **user description** relates to the need and is detailed. The **need** is specific and generative of ideas - we want to solve this for Sugata. Finally, the **goal/insight** is a deeper understanding of why the user has that need and gives us important context.

Let's look at one more good example of a POV Statement.
Given the following design challenge of: Redesign the ground experience at the local international airport. Here is a potential POV: **Harried mother of three, rushing through the airport only to wait hours at the gate,** needs **to entertain
her playful children** because **“annoying little brats” only irritate already frustrated fellow passengers**. 

## Potential Point of View Statements

**Time: 6 minutes**

Each person should write their own POV statements silently.

## Final Point of View Statement

**Time: 4 minutes**

Now take the best elements of your team member's POV Statements and merge them into a final POV Statement.

## How to Write How Might We Questions

In the Define Worksheet write How Might We questions.

The How Might We is created based on the POV Statment. It asks a question that will generate ideas solutions for our user.

The scope of our HMW question is important.  For example, between the (possibly) too narrow “HMW create a cone to eat
ice cream without dripping” and the too broad “HMW redesign dessert” might be the properly scoped
“HMW redesign ice cream to be more portable.” 

From the earlier POV: Harried mother of three, rushing through the airport only to wait hours at the gate, needs to entertain
her playful children because “annoying little brats” only irritate already frustrated fellow passengers. Here are HMW questions generated from the prompts in bold.

- **Amp up the good:** HMW use the kids’ energy to entertain fellow passenger?

- **Remove the bad:** HMW separate the kids from fellow passengers?

- **Explore the opposite:** HMW make the wait the most exciting part of the trip?

- **Question an assumption:** HMW entirely remove the wait time at the airport?

- **Go after adjectives:** HMW we make the rush refreshing instead of harrying?

- **ID unexpected resources:** HMW leverage free time of fellow passengers to share the load?

- **Create an analogy from need or context:** HMW make the airport like a spa? Like a playground?

- **Play against the challenge:** HMW make the airport a place that kids want to go?
Change a status quo: HMW make playful, loud kids less annoying?
Break POV into pieces: HMW entertain kids? HMW slow a mom down? HMW mollify delayed passengers? 

## Individual HMW Questions

**Time: 8 minutes**

Silently and individually make HMW questions. Each person should try to come up with as many as possible.

The prompts above to aid in coming up with ideas.

## Read Individual HMW Questions

**Time: 3 minutes**

Spend 30 seconds each reading your HMW questions.

## Collaborative HMW Questions

**Time: 4 minutes**

Build on the ideas you have had to come up with new HMW questions.

## Final HMW Questions

**Time: 4 minutes**

Choose three how might we questions. Based on the criteria that it is: 1) generative of ideas and 2) it will most likely lead to answers that meets your user's needs.

## Mark Done on Your Master Link Document

Once you complete the POV and HMW statements on the Define Worksheet, mark an **x** in the done column for the Define .
