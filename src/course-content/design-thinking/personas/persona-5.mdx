# Persona #5

## Musician

Sean is a 29 year old guitarist who earned a Bachelor of Music from Juillaird, a world renowned music program. Sean stayed in New York City after graduating. Although he primarily studied classical music in school, Sean has moved towards playing folk acoustic guitar and singing in the past few years.

One of the reasons Sean became a folk singer songwriter is because he enjoys the unscripted interactions between bandmates and audience members. Before the pandemic, Sean played live three to four times a week mostly at the same few regular restaurants and musical venues. In addition, he taught students guitar during the day.

Since the pandemic, Sean has found it difficult to make enough income to cover his rent and bills. Most of his guitar students are young, so it is hard to engage them in the same way he was used to in person. Of his three bandmates, two moved out of New York to avoid the high rent and one has been focused on her role as an advertising campaign manager.
