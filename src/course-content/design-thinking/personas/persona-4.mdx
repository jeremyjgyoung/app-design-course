# Persona #4

## Healthcare Worker

Annie is an essential worker. She works as an audiologist and, after her office briefly closed in March, has been working with patients in-person during the pandemic. Her office is responsible for making sure that their current patients are able to hear through hearing aids and other devices and that new patients can find out if they are hard of hearing and seek treatment.

The office takes a lot of precautionary measures to protect the doctors and the patients from the coronavirus. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty due to a lack of testing. There is no requirement for doctors or patients to test on a regular basis and no way to know if any patient has been infected. 

Annie’s concern about catching or spreading the disease has made her incredibly nervous to take any risks. She has only seen her family twice since March and has not spent any time in person with her friends.
