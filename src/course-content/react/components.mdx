# Components

## Components' Syntax & Concepts

Components are written with the component name surrounded by "<" and ">".

```jsx
// This is a Text component
<Text>My text component</Text>
```

Inside the component you will often have more information like text or another component.

```jsx
// Text inside of the two tags
<Text>Here is text.</Text>

// Other components
<View>
    <View></View>
    <View></View>
</View>
```

Some components like the Image component don't need anything inside of it so it does not have a closing tag.

```jsx
// Self-Closing Tag
<Image />

// More information
<Text>Here is text.</Text>
```

Within the first tag there will often be something to tell the component more information.
For instance, where the image is located or how to style the component.
These are called props or attributes.

```jsx
// The Text component with a style prop
<Text style={styles.title}>Press Me</Text>

// The Image component with a style prop and a source prop
<Image
    style={styles.image}
    source={require("./forest-image.jpg")} 
/>
// Note that the white space makes it easier to read but has the same function
```

## The View Component

Components are visual pieces of our app.
So far we have encountered the View component which you can think of as a rectangular box.

```jsx
// The View component
<View></View>
```

Props (or attributes) provide more information to the component. 
The **style** prop connects the component to the styles in the StyleSheet.

```jsx
// The View component with a style prop
<View style={styles.container}></View>
```

## The Text Component

The text in your app should all be wrapped in a Text component.

```jsx
<View>
    Incorrect way to show text.
</View>

<View>
    <Text>Correct way to show text.</Text>
</View>
```

The text style prop includes the text's color, fontSize, fontStyle, and fontWeight.

```jsx
// Example Text
<Text style={styles.appTitle}>App Title</Text>

// Example StyleSheet
let styles = StyleSheet.create({
    appTitle: {
        color: "#00ff00",
        fontSize: 18,
        fontStyle: "italic",
        fontWeight: "400",
    },
});
```

## The Image Component

The Image component tells the computer which file to load, in addition
to the width and height of the image.

```jsx
<Image 
    style={styles.dogImage}
    source={require('./fluffy-dog.jpg')} 
/>
```

The Image tag does not have a closing tag because we don't put things inside of an Image tag. 
Note when you have multiple props for a component you will often put it on different lines to make the component more readable.

## The TouchableOpacity Component

TouchableOpacity is used as a button.
It has a special attribute called onPress which runs code when the button is pressed.

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity
    style={styles.pressMeButton}
    onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
>
</TouchableOpacity>
```
Refer to the box model when adding styles to TouchableOpacity.

If you text in your button you'll need to embed a Text component within the TouchableOpacity component.

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity
    style={styles.pressMeButton}
    onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
>
    <Text>Press Me</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```
