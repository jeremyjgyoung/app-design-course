## Final HMW Questions

**Time: 1 minute**

Copy and paste the final 3 HMW Questions from your Define Worksheet.

## Round One

**Time: 10 minutes**

In Round One you will come up with ideas silently on your own.

In this section you will come up with as many app ideas as possible. Hold back judgement for yourself and others for wild ideas. 

Each idea is an answer to a How Might We question. You can spend about 3 minutes on each of question or spend more time on the HMW that sparks more ideas.

## Share Out Ideas

**Time: 8 minutes**

Each person takes one minute to share and explain their ideas their ideas. Then spend two minutes seeing similarities and grouping between ideas.

## Round Two

**Time: 10 minutes**

In Round Two you will come up with ideas together out loud. Remember to defer judgement and default to saying an idea even if it feels difficult to implement or silly (we will use our critical brain later).

In this round there should be a lot of energy building on each other's ideas. Remember to encourage other people's ideas and step back if you are dominating the idea space.

## Discuss Idea Groupings

**Time: 6 minutes**

Discuss what groups of ideas have emerged. Add a few ideas to collective ideas in the Round Two area if you think of ways to merge ideas.

## Round Three

**Time: 6 minutes**

Choose three of your ideas to prototype.

Select your best three ideas based on the following criteria:
- Solves for your usersâ€™ need
- Original/interesting
- Your group can build a prototype in 3.5 days

Feel free to spend time merging or wordsmithing ideas in the collective ideas area if you need to.
