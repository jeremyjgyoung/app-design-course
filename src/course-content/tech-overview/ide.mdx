An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a place to write and run code.

The left side of the IDE is the file explorer where you see the files and folders of your project, the middle portion is where you write your code,
and the right side of the IDE is where you see the result of your code.

At the top of the IDE you have an area to change the name of the project, save the project, or access your account.
Near the bottom you can press Prettier to format your code and click on the left-hand side you can see the logs and problems with your app.
