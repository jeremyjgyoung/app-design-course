# Persona #7

## Restaurant Owner

Veronica owns a restaurant downtown Redwood City, California. Veronica grew up in the restaurant industry helping at the restaurant her parentâ€™s managed with whatever they needed. It has been a dream of hers to own her own Italian restaurant.

Five years ago, Veronica opened her own restaurant. The restaurant has become a staple of the city with a steady flow of regular customers who filled the restaurant on weekends. People enjoy the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant.

During the pandemic, Veronica has found it difficult to make ends meet. The restaurant revenue is down by half. Her regular customer base has started cooking more from home. She has tried to negotiate with her landlord, but the landlord has not budged on the rent. In order to deal with decreased revenue, Veronica has let go of half of her employees  but now finds it difficult to make last minute substitutions for servers and chefs with a limited staff.
