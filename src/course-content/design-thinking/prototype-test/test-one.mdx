Make a copy of the worksheet and fill in your names and group number in the title and body of the document.

You will have one worksheet per group and fill out your feedback on the other group's worksheet.

## Add the URL to the Master Link Document

Make the link shareable for your Test One worksheet. Share it with your partners, the folks giving you feedback, and put it into your Master Link Document.

## Share Your Prototypes

**Time: 6 minutes**

Explain your prototypes and frame the feedback that would be most helpful. Spend a little over a minute explaining each app.

## Hear Feedback

**Time: 10 minutes**

Have groups give you feedback on your prototypes and write notes in the proper area.

Each person should write notes in their area and choose the app they think you should continue working on.

## Hear About Prototypes & Give Feedback

**Time: 16 minutes**

Now reverse the roles of the groups. See directions above.

## Mark Done on Your Master Link Document

Once you have completed hearing and giving your feedback, mark an **x** in the done column for the Test One Worksheet.
