# What is empathy?

Empathy is our ability to take on another person's perspective and feelings.

## What is the empathize mode?

In the empathize mode of design thinking, we seek to understand a person or many people's collective thoughts and feelings.

Two ways to empathize include shadowing person throughout their day or to interview a group of people you wish to understand better. We can take steps to develop a sense of understanding of a person or group of people, but there is no final destination in journey of understanding others.

For this course, we will read personas prepared to give insights to what a person may experience and need during the pandemic. You will also read articles relating to people who may be experiencing similar situations to the persona you have chosen.
