# Activity Set 2.1

This activity set will introduce you to the Image and TouchableOpacity components.

<a href="https://snack.expo.io/@jeremyjgyoung/activity-set-2.1" target="_blank"  class="mdxLink">Activity Set 2.1 Code</a>

## Activity I: Change the alert Text

What do you think will happen when you press the Press Me button?

Look at the code and then press the button.

Click on "No errors" on the bottom left of the IDE.
Then click on "LOGS" to see the result of console.log.

Then change the text in the *alert*. Make sure you keep the quotes the same.

```jsx
// Before
let functionActivatedWhenPressed = () => {
    alert("Pressed!");
    console.log("Yeah, definitely pressed the button");
};
```

```jsx
// After
let functionActivatedWhenPressed = () => {
    alert("This is something else now!");
    console.log("Yeah, definitely pressed the button");
};
```

Press the button again to see the what has changed.

When the button is pressed it uses the code in functionActivatedWhenPressed is used.
TouchableOpacity is a component that we will use as a button.

Take a moment to trace the code relevant to the button press.

## Activity II: Change the Name of the Function

Above the TouchableOpacity component add an Image component.

```jsx
// Before
let functionActivatedWhenPressed = () => {
    alert("This is something else now!");
    console.log("Yeah, definitely pressed the button");
};
```

```jsx
// After
let pressAlert = () => {
    alert("This is something else now!");
    console.log("Yeah, definitely pressed the button");
};
```

There is an error because the program is still looking for a function named functionActivatedWhenPressed.
We need to change the name of the function referenced after onPress.

```jsx
// Before
return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TouchableOpacity
        style={styles.pressMeButton}
        onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
      >
        <Text>Press Me</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
);
```

```jsx
// After
return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TouchableOpacity
        style={styles.pressMeButton}
        onPress={pressAlert}
      >
        <Text>Press Me</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
);
```

Now we have a function name that is shorter yet descriptive.

Note that the camelCased words after the **let** keyword are variable names.
Variables can be named many things as long as you are consistent with the name where you reference the variable.

## Activity III: Add an Image

Above the TouchableOpacity component add an Image component.
The Image component uses a source attribute to find the relevant file.

Imagine how this will change the look of this app.

```jsx
// Before
return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <TouchableOpacity
            style={styles.pressMeButton}
            onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
        >
            <Text>Press Me</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
);
```

```jsx
// After
return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Image style={styles.dogImage} source={require('./fluffy-dog.jpg')} />
        <TouchableOpacity
            style={styles.pressMeButton}
            onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
        >
            <Text>Press Me</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
);
```

Surprisingly, at this point we still don't see a picture render to the screen. 
Images require a height and width.

Add a dogImage property to the StyleSheet below the pressMeButton property.
Make sure to include the correct punctuation.

```jsx
// Add width and height to the StyleSheet with the property of dogImage
dogImage: {
    width: '64px',
    height: '96px',
}
```

Feel free to try different widths and heights for the image.

Let's move onto to the explanation of this activity set.
