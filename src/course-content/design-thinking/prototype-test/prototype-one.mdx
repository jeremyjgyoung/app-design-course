## Descriptions of Three Apps

**Time: 6 minutes**

For three apps, write a description as a group. Remember to talk more if you haven't talked much so far and to talk less if you have done more of the talking.

## Drawing of Three Apps

**Time: 20 minutes**

Split up who is drawing each of the apps.

The drawing should include a drawing of each screen with key features. You can add arrows with descriptions and arrows to show which screen to navigate to next. The drawings should be a visual aid that make you able to describe your app to someone clearly. Focus on making it clear what the app does not making it look amazing.

The easiest way to add a drawing to this doc is to click on the area you want to add a drawing. Then on the top tool bar click on: Insert >  Drawing > + New.

## Mark Done on Your Master Link Document

Once you complete the drawings and descriptions of the three apps, mark an **x** in the done column for Prototype One.
