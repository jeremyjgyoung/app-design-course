# What is the Define mode?

During define we build off our empathy work to define our user, their needs, and our insights.

This process often includes creating a Point Of View (POV) statement and a How Might We (HMW) question. The POV Statement defines our user, their needs, and an insight. The HMW question frames our users' needs as specific opportunity to be solved for without hinting at a solution.
