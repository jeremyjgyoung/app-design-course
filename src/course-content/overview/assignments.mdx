# Assignments

For each assignment, there is a similar process for submission. Let's practice by completing and submitting an assignment.

## Master Link Document Directions

First we will make our own copy of the Master Link Document. We will only need to do this once for this course.

**Step One**

Make a copy of the Master Link Document. Each student will have their own copy.

**Step Two**

Rename it with your group and your name.

Fill out your name, group, and team member(s).
