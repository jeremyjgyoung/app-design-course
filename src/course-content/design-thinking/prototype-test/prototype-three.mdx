</a>

Make a copy of the worksheet and fill in your names and group number in the title and body of the document.

## Prototype Three Plans

**Time: 20 minutes**

Build the vision for your third prototype based on testing from your second prototype. You can use as much of the last prototype as is useful. Don't spend time re-doing work.

## Project Management

**Time: 10 minutes**

Define what work needs to be done before Test Three then split up the work. Insert links to relevant resources.
