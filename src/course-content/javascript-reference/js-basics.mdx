# Code Basics

Code is instructions to the computer.

## Languages

In Expo, we are using JavaScript and JSX code.
JavaScript is the language that the web is built on.
We use it to add functionality to our apps.

Here is an example of some JavaScript code.

```js
let heightToInches = (feet, inches) => {
  return feet * 12 + inches;
};

let tallestHeight = heightToInches(8, 11);
console.log(tallestHeight);
```

JSX is a modern way of placing the design elements in together
with the code that is in control of our functionality.
If you are familiar with HTML, JSX looks very similar.

Here is an example of JSX being used alongside JavaScript.

```jsx
// Each of the components (View, TouchableOpacity, and Text) are JSX components
// Note there is also JavaScript inside of JSX
// The JavaScript is written inside of curly braces {}
<View>
  <TouchableOpacity
    onPress={functionActivatedWhenPressed}
  >
    <Text>Press Me</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
</View>
```

The StyleSheet object is written in JavaScript but it most similar to CSS in web development

```js
let styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: "#00ffff",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  },
  boxOne: {
    backgroundColor: "#0000ff",
    width: "200px",
    height: "100px",
    padding: "20px",
    borderWidth: "5px",
    borderColor: "#ff00ff",
    margin: "50px",
  },
  boxTwo: {
    backgroundColor: "#ff0000",
    width: "200px",
    height: "100px",
  },
  exampleText: {
    color: "#ffffff",
  },
});
```

Here is the same code in CSS:

```CSS
.container: {
  flex: 1;
  background-color: #00ffff;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
.boxOne: {
  background-color: #0000ff;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-color: #ff00ff;
  margin: 50px;
}
.boxTwo: {
  background-color: #ff0000;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
}
.exampleText: {
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

There are small differences like the punctuation and naming of properties.
Looking up CSS rules and reformatting it to a StyleSheet can be helpful in styling your app.

## Syntax

In code there are keywords that have special meanings.
Some of these words are built into the language, for instance **return** and **let** have special meanings in JavaScript.
Often we use words that have special meaning from a library, for instance **TouchableOpacity** is a special word that
uses code from folks at React Native.

```jsx
// Notice all of the punctuation with {}, (), ;, and ,
// Every word in here is a keyword except for styles and thisCouldBeAnyName
import React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View } from "react-native";

let App = () => {
  return (
    // styles.thisCouldBeAnyName is a reference to the style object below
    <View style={styles.thisCouldBeAnyName}>
    </View>
  );
};

// styles is a variable name - other words would work too
let styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // thisCouldBeAnyName is a property name - other words would work here too
  thisCouldBeAnyName: {
    backgroundColor: "#00ffff",
    height: "100%",
  },
});

export default App;
```

In code, the punctuation is also extremely important.
Each comma, curly brace, parenthesis, and semi-colon has a purpose.
Semi-colons for instance are used similar to periods at the end of a sentence.

## alert() & console.log()

In order to figure out why your code is not working, it can be useful to see certain values.

With alert() you will see the value as a pop up and console.log() will print values to the console.

## Comments

Comments are:
1. not run as code
2. helpful for notes to programmers
3. useful tools to toggle code on or off

```js
// This is a comment
// Comments are start with two slashes // in JS
// You can toggle comments with Ctrl + /

console.log("This line is run as code");
```
