# Prototype Two Directions

## Prototype Two Worksheet

You only need one Prototype Two Worksheet per group. Below is a link to the relavent worksheet to fill out for this section.

    Prototype Two Plan & Project Management
</a>

Make a copy of the worksheet and fill in your names and group number in the title and body of the document.

## Prototype Two Plans

**Time: 20 minutes**

Type out the title of your app, the description, and drawings. For the overall drawing of your app, you will draw a drawing of how all of the screens relate to each other. 

For each screen, you will be more detailed enough that someone else should be able to take the screen and make it for you without you talking to them. You can add or delete parts of this template if you're using more or fewer numbers of screens.

## Project Management

**Time: 10 minutes**

Define what work needs to be done before Test Two then split up the work. Insert links to relevant resources.

    Prototype Two Starter
</a>

Open up the starter app, rename it, save it, then put the links in the Links to App area, and start working on your app. It is most likely easiest to work on several code bases and then to combine them later.

Each time you make a major revision you can save your progress and rename the title so you have the old work saved to come back to.

## Mark Done on Your Master Link Document

Once you complete the drawings and descriptions of the three apps, mark an **x** in the done column for Prototype Two.
