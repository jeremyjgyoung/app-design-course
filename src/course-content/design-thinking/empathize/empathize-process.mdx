## Discuss

## Interview (Optional)

**Time to Prepare: ~30 minutes**

**Time to Interview: ~20 minutes**

If you know someone who fits into the demographic you are solving for, then an interview will add depth to your understanding of this group. It is important to value your interviewees time, so prepare questions that fill in the gaps in your research.

Start an interview setting expectations of what the interview is for and how long you expect to spend interviewing. Fifteen to thirty minutes is a reasonable amount of time to spend interviewing a person.

Next build rapport - ask for someone's background and check in with them before launching into questions. Note how they feel about things and how they talk about things. Spend time listening and ask follow up questions rather than going straight down your list of questions.

## Mark Done on Your Master Link Document

Once you complete the notes on your persona and article, mark an **x** in the done column for Empathize.
