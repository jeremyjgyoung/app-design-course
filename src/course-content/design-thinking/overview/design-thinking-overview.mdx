# Design Thinking

## What is design thinking?

Design thinking is a methodology for problem solving that is rooted in understanding a user. Design thinking is often associated with a mindset of creative problem solving and a process for coming to a solution.

## What is the design thinking process?

Design thinking uses a process to build a solution for a user. Here we are using the modes of the process outlined by Stanford's d. school. 

**Stages of the Design Thinking Process**
- Empathize – Develop an understanding of the people you are solving for.
- Define – Understand your users’ needs and develop insights.
- Ideate – Come up with with solutions for your users' needs.
- Prototype – Create solutions for your users' needs.
- Test – Learn how your prototype can be improved.

Although the modes of this process are listed in a particular order, the practitioner of design thinking will often skip around from one mode to another. For instance, if you learn in testing that you are solving a problem that doesn't exist for the user you may want to empathize to develop a greater understanding of your user.

This video does a great job in describing the process. We will replace the problem statement in our case with a Point of View statement and How Might We questions.

## What are the benefits of design thinking?

There are many ways of coming up with solutions to peoples' problems. The benefit of design thinking is that it takes time to find the right solution for a user by coming to a deep understanding of the users' needs, thinking of creative solutions, and quick iterations of potential solutions.

For optimizing a product, when you already have the solution in mind (ie. making an external hard drive smaller, faster, and cheaper) an engineering process may be a more appropriate.
