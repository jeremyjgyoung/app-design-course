## A Series of Boxes

A good way to view of an app design is to think of
any element on the screen as a box from text to buttons.
Your job as a designer is to place, style, and size these boxes.

## A Box

A box has four elements that take up space: the content, padding, border, and margin from inside out.

An example of content is text with a certain width and height. Padding is the space between the content and the border.
Often there is not a visual border for a box. When there is a border it is between the padding and margin.
Finally, the margin is the space between the box and other elements.
