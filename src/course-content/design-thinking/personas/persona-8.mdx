# Persona #8

## Elderly Folks

Judy is 80 years old. She has two children and two grandchildren. One of her children lives across the country from her and she has not seen him since a few months before the pandemic hit. 

Judy lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, near her second child and his family, his wife and two children. She has seen them a few times but always at a distance. Judy has cancer, and that combined with her age makes her extremely vulnerable to the coronavirus. She has to be exceedingly careful but she misses her family.

She also often gets her son to run errands for her to minimize her risks but sometimes he is busy. Judy is concerned about being in stores that are full of people.
