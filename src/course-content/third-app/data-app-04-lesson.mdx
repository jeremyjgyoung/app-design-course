## Activity I: Add To Dos

Add a few to do items by typing into the text input and clicking ADD TO DO.

Refresh your browser when you're done adding to the to do list.

## Activity II: Add a Text Component

Below the button add a text component that shows the current toDo.

```jsx title=App.js
// Before
<Button title="Add To Do" onPress={updateToDoList} />

// After
<Button title="Add To Do" onPress={updateToDoList} />
<Text>{toDo}</Text>
```

Now type something into the box.

You will see that the to do updates automatically whenever you type.
This gives you insight to how the to do list works.
The current to do is always set to the variable toDo, then it is added to the
toDoList array whenever you press ADD TO DO.

## Activity III: Delete the Text Component

Now delete the text component below the button.
It was used to explain how the to do list works.

```jsx title=App.js
// Before
<Button title="Add To Do" onPress={updateToDoList} />
<Text>{toDo}</Text>

// After
<Button title="Add To Do" onPress={updateToDoList} />
```

## Activity IV: Change the To Do Styling

Change the style of the to dos and then add some to dos.

```jsx title=App.js
// Relevant code
toDoView: {
  marginTop: 20,
  backgroundColor: '#9999bb',
  padding: 10,
},
toDoText: {
  fontSize: 20,
},
```
