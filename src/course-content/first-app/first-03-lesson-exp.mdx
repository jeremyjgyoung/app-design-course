# Explanation of Activity Set Three

This will explain the concepts from the last activity set.

# The Text Component

The text in your app should all be wrapped in a Text component.

```jsx
<View>
    Incorrect way to show text.
</View>

<View>
    <Text>Correct way to show text.</Text>
</View>
```

The text style prop includes the text's color, fontSize, fontStyle, and fontWeight.

```jsx
// Example Text
<Text style={styles.appTitle}>App Title</Text>

// Example StyleSheet
let styles = StyleSheet.create({
    appTitle: {
        color: "#00ff00",
        fontSize: 18,
        fontStyle: "italic",
        fontWeight: "400",
    },
});
```

# More Flexbox

## The Two Axes

There are two axes: the main axis and the cross axis.

If the flex direction is in the row orientation, then the main axis runs from left to right and the cross axis runs from top to bottom.
If the flex direction is in the column orientation, then the main axis runs from top to bottom and the cross axis runs from left to right.

## justifyContent and alignItems

The children of the main container can be at the start (flex-start), end (flex-end), or center.
On the main axis justifyContent is the property to use and on the cross axis alignItems is the property to use.

Change the axis, justifyContent, and alignItems, respectively, with the dropdowns below.

<FlexAxes />

# The Box Model

A good way to view of an app design is to think of
any element on the screen as a box from text to buttons.
Your job as a designer is to place, style, and size these boxes.

A box has four elements that take up space: the content, padding, border, and margin from inside out.

An example of content is text with a certain width and height. Padding is the space between the content and the border.
Often there is not a visual border for a box. When there is a border it is between the padding and margin.
Finally, the margin is the space between the box and other elements.
