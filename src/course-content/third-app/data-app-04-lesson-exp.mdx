# Explanation of Activity Set 3.4

This will explain the concepts from the last activity set.

# Imports

When you are using other peoples code, you must import it at the top. 
Often other peoples code will start with capital letters.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, TouchableOpacity } from "react-native";
```

# The Right Components

All of the code in the return statement should be wrapped in a single View component.

```jsx
return (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <Text style={styles.titleText}>FOREST APP</ Text>
    <Image
      style={styles.image}
      source={require('./forest-image.jpg')}
    />
    <TouchableOpacity
      style={styles.button}
      onPress={onPressFunction}
    >
      <Text>Press Me</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  </View>
);
```

All of your text should be wrapped in a Text component.

# Spelling & Symbols

Spelling is one of the biggest reasons for code not working. 
Make sure you are spelling words correctly and consistently.

Whitespace typically does not affect code, but other symbols do. Make sure you have the correct symbols.
